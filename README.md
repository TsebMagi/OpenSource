#Description
This project is an open source dice rolling application for the android platform.

The current build supports rolling the traditional set of polyhedrol die (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20) in reasonable quantities.

The output displays the individual rolls as well as the total rolled for each type of die.

#Future Development

Future development includes adding the ability to roll customized die that can be defined by the user, as well as a better randomizer.

#Installation
To install download the pollyhedroll.apk file to your android device and open it to start the android installer. Depending on your systems settings you may have a box that comes up and asks if you are sure you want to allow third-party software.
